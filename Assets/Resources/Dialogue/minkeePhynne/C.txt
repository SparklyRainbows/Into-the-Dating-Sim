Narrator: <i>Inside the Min Sheng Kee bakery, Min Kee happily serves her customers the most delicious “always fresh never frozen bread” in the kingdom.</>
Narrator: <i>Suddenly, she hears a thump outside. Min Kee rushes out to see the bread that she threw at Vhall... faceplanted on the ground?</>
Minkee shock: Oh! Um, are you the bread I threw earlier? Are you okay? How are you feeling?
Phynne: My feelings? Oh don’t worry about those, no one else does.
Minkee angry: That's not true! I care a lot! 
Minkee sad: I'm sorry about throwing you. How can I ever make it up to you?
Minkee happy: Oh I know! Do you like bread? I can make you some whale bread, pineapple bread, slime bread...
Minkee sad: Wait never mind, will bread bring back bad memories of me throwing you onto the streets? Sorry!
Phynne: ...
Minkee shock: Would you prefer a hug instead? Money? I don't have a lot of money to spare, but if it'll make you feel better...
Phynne: ...
Minkee sad: Please, tell me how I can make it up to you! I don't know what to do to make things better between us!
Phynne: You don't understand me, empress. No one d0es. Your apologies are meaningless.
