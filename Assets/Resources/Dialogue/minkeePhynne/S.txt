Minkee happy: ~~Heya Phynne (^_^)~~ How's the <e>swirling tempest that is your soul</> today?
Phynne blushing: ???
Phynne: (Was that...edginess?) 
Phynne: <n>I'm great now that you're...here...</>
Minkee happy: That's wonderful! 
Minkee: Um, I mean, <e>yes, our edge has coalesced and now we are one singular darkness.</>
Phynne blushing: <n>You mustn't</> corrupt your soul for me! 
Phynne blushing: <n>I like you...No, I love you for who you are.</>
Phynne blushing: Minkee, you're the <n>yang</> to my yin, the <n>light</> to my dark. You're the <n>calm</> in the center of my storm. 
Phynne blushing: <n>I need you to balance out my</> infinite edge.
Phynne blushing: <n>We're perfect for each other;</> from the forbidden entanglement of our souls emerges a perfect duality.
Phynne blushing: <n>Your light shines the brightest</> when it's surrounded by my darkness.
Minkee happy: Phynne...!
Minkee blushing: It's alright, <e>light cannot exist without dark, and within me in a darkness that yearns to meet with yours.</>
Narrator: <i>Minkee moves to give Phynne a warm embrace. Phynne smiles and hugs back.</>
