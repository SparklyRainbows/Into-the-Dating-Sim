Narrator: <i>At the Min Sheng Kee bakery…</i>
Vhall: Can I get the whale bread again?
Minkee happy: Yes, of course! One house special, coming right...
Minkee angry: Hold on, I thought I told you to leave!
Vhall wink: Ah, I simply couldn’t resist the delicious whale bread...and the manager.
Minkee annoyed: Now that I think about it, weren’t you here yesterday? And the day before that?
Minkee annoyed: Why do you keep coming back if you think my bread is trash?
Vhall: The truth is, I’m an envoy, sent here to improve relations between our countries.
Vhall wink: Coming to this bakery is very important to building relationships, of course...
Minkee annoyed: I’m sure there are bakeries where you’re from too.
Vhall: Well yes, there’s Ding Tai Fung, my favorite restaurant. I’m always down for DTF. 
Vhall: They have bread too, very delicious beta bread. I wonder how Min Sheng Kee’s bread compares...
Minkee annoyed: If you like bread so much, why don’t you bake it yourself? Instead of harassing people who make it for you.
Vhall sad: QQ My plan to seduce Empress Min has gone a rye...
Minkee: (~Sigh~ I guess I can’t be too annoyed if he’s paying...)
Minkee happy: (He does help me rake in a ton of dough!)
Minkee: Whatever. It's not like I'm going to kick you out again.
