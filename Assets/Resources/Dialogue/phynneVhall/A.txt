Vhall: That was an intense battle...I barely had a chance to catch my breath.
Vhall sad: If it weren't for the way you slayed those hordes of beasts, I don't think I would be here still.
Vhall: After that last battle, I can sense the storm raging within you. 
Vhall: And I...<e>I feel the storm too</>. It's baking me crazy. 
Phynne blushing: Our darkness coalesces into a vast infinite void.
Vhall: I'm starting to glimpse that darkness in myself. It's like a hunger that never ends. 
Vhall sad: Is this how you feel every day? How do you live with such pain, such emptiness inside you?
Phynne: They told me i would never survive...but survive was my middle name. 
Vhall shock: Really?
Vhall blushing: Every day I learn something new about you.
Phynne blushing: The spite alone drives me, fuels me.
Vhall: Then it seems we have much more in common than I thought.
