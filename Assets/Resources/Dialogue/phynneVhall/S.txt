Vhall: You know, I thought you were kinda weird when I met you at first.
Phynne: ...
Vhall shock: No, I mean-!!!
Vhall blushing: Aah, after getting to know you better, uh...
Vhall DTF: You... actually have a very deep and complicated personality. 
Phynne: The depths of my black soul knows no bounds. 
Phynne blushing: Nor do I know the bounds of this attraction I have for your energy.
Phynne blushing: I've finally found someone who understands this darkness within me...
Vhall DTF: I feel the same way.
Phynne blushing: I'd face god and walk backwards into hell for you.
Vhall DTF: <e>I would slay the god that would keep us apart.</>
