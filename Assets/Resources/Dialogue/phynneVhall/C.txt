Narrator: <i>Outside the Min Sheng Kee bakery...</>
Vhall happy: Wow, was that some good bread! Min Sheng Kee does live up to its reputation. Not that I'd let Min Kee know~
Narrator: <i>Vhall almost steps on something, then backs away quickly.</>
Vhall shock: Wait, yuck, what's that on the ground? 
Vhall: Oh, it's just the bread that Min Kee threw at me...Gross. Don't want naan of that!
Narrator: <i>The bread begins to move away from Vhall. </>
Vhall: wtf
Narrator: <i>The bread rounds the corner, and starts to fuse with other pieces of bread and filth on the ground.</>
Phynne: The darkness that lives inside me is itching to escape.
Vhall shock: Huh?!? Who said that?! Show yourself, foe!
Narrator: <i>Vhall grabs his axe and swings it viciously at the rising figure.</>
Vhall angry: Hah...!!!
Phynne: I am Phynne. With a Ph, y, two n's and an e.
Vhall confused: Oh. Uh, okay. My bad, Fin. I thought you were an enemy for a hot sec.
Narrator: <i>Phynne looks at Vhall like he's an idiot. He clearly just formed from bread. Soon, he is overwhelmed by Vhall's obvious edgy charm.</>
Phynne blushing: Something about your aura...It calls to me.
Vhall: Uh, sure man. Look, I gotta go, uh, I have bread in the oven.
Narrator: <i>Vhall walks away as fast as he can, leaving Phynne standing outside of the restaurant.</>
