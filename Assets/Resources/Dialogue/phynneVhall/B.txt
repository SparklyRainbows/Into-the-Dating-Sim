Vhall blushing: (I wonder how Min Kee's doing...Man do I miss her delicious, steamy buns, fresh from the oven.)
Phynne: ...
Vhall shock: Whoa, dude, where did you come from? Have you been following me? God, please don't tell me you're the stalker type...
Phynne: I can sense the darkness in your heart. It calls to me. It yearns for sweet release.
Vhall: Uuuuuh...haha...Of course...
Narrator: <i>Vhall begins to edge away from Phynne.</>
Phynne: They laugh @ me because I'm different, I laugh @ them because they're all the same.
Vhall angry: What's with the symbols?! Are you trying to get a rise out of me? I can give you a knuckle sandwich if you'd like!
Phynne: I do not feel pain. Pain is weakness leaving the body. 
Phynne: Surely you understand the true depths of suffering in this wretched place.
Vhall confused: What...? Uh, sure man, whatever floats your boat.
Vhall: (I gotta get out of here before he tries to drag me down to hell with him.)
Vhall: I have, uh, more bread in the oven. Bye!
