Vhall: Yo Phynne, do you ever wash your cloak? I don't think I've ever seen you wear anything else.
Phynne: I'll stop wearing black when they invent a darker color.
Vhall: I guess we all have our unique tastes.

Vhall: So, uh, what's with the edginess? What happened in your life to make you that way?
Vhall: Tell me all about your tragic backstory.
Phynne: The devil whispered to me, "You'll never withstand the storm.”
Phynne: I whispered back, "I am the storm."
Vhall: ...Fascinating.

Vhall: These slimes...They just keep coming! There's no end to them!
Vhall: They torment me every day, and even at night I cannot escape from them; they haunt my dreams.
Vhall: Phynne, how do you handle this?
Phynne: I don't fear my demons because I'm one of them.
Vhall: Become your demons, huh...? But I'm not a slime...
