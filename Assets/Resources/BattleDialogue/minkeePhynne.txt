Minkee: Great insight as always, Phynne!
Minkee: ...Wait. Was Phynne predicting my death?

Minkee: Phynne, how do you deal with having to fight battle after battle? It seems endless.
Minkee: It's wearing me down...Even my dreams are filled with strife and warfare now.
Phynne: Being insane is what's keeping me alive from my nightmares.
Minkee: Thanks for sharing, but I don't think that'll help with my situation.

Minkee: You take the slimes on the left, Phynne! I'll cover you!
Phynne: No.
Minkee: You don't crust me?
Phynne: No.
Minkee: What? Why not?
Phynne: Even the devil was once an angel.

Phynne: Nothing personnel, slime.
Minkee: Oh my! You just killed that slime with no remorse at all...Don't you feel bad when you kill your own kind?
Phynne: Nothing can faze my damned soul.
